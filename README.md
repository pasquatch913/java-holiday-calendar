## java-holiday-calendar

This library provides a clean interface for determining whether a particular date is a holiday.
The default configuration includes only US bank holidays, but clear improvements would include settings for holidays from other countries.

The primary usage pattern for this library is the below:

1. build and configure a HolidayCalendar
1. check if a particular date is a holiday based on the HolidayCalendar configuration
